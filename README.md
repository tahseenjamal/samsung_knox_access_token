When I wrote this code, Samsung Knox portal had only Java, Javascript and .Net code and that too using Knox Package

So I decided to write a code from scratch without using any Knox library


Python version 3.9

conda install pyjwt # In case you have conda environment

or else

pip install pyjwt # in case you have virtual env or even in conda environment
